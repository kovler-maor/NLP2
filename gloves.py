from gensim.downloader import load  # Assuming a generic downloader utility

# Define GloVe models to load
glove_twitter_200 = load('glove-twitter-200')  # 200-dimensional GloVe embeddings trained on Twitter data
glove_6B_100 = load('glove-wiki-gigaword-100')  # 100-dimensional GloVe embeddings trained on Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5

# At this point, `glove_twitter_200`, `glove_6B_100`, and `glove_6B_300` would contain the loaded GloVe models
